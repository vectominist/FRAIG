# FRAIG
Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Graph  
Final Project of the course Data Structure and Programming 2018 Fall, NTUEE

## Commands
1. CIRRead: read in a circuit and construct the netlist
2. CIRPrint: print circuit
3. CIRGate: report a gate
4. CIRWrite: write the netlist to an ASCII AIG file (.aag)
5. CIRSWeep: remove unused gates
6. CIROPTimize: perform trivial optimizations
7. CIRSTRash: perform structural hash on the circuit netlist
8. CIRSIMulate: perform Boolean logic simulation on the circuit
9. CIRFraig: perform FRAIG operation on the circuit
